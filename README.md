# Stock Price Forecasting

## Problem Statement

The Stock Price Forecasting project focuses on predicting stock prices for a specific company by harnessing historical stock price data. By employing advanced time-series forecasting techniques, this project offers valuable insights for investors, traders, and financial analysts.

## Dataset

For this project, I utilized a comprehensive financial market dataset, Apple Stock Price from Kaggle. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and validating our stock price forecasting models.

## Model

Implemented deep learning through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for precise time-series predictions. The strength of LSTM lies in its ability to capture intricate patterns and dependencies within sequential data, making it exceptionally well-suited for forecasting stock prices. This advanced technique was seamlessly integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing users to effortlessly upload CSV files and obtain accurate predictions, marking a sophisticated yet accessible approach to stock price forecasting
